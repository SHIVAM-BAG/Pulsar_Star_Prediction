        "[Pulse stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLk_72V9Bw) are a rare type of [Neutron stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCwDNXKlN8Q) that produce radio emissions detectable on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can learn more about the Pulsar and neutron star by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrMvUL8HFlM).\n",
        "\n",
        "As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, it produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation. Thus a potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. The classification algorithms, in particular, are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate datasets as binary classification problems (predict either `0` or `1`). Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class (less in numbers), and the remaining examples are a majority negative class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The class labels used are `0` (negative class) and `1` (positive class). Hence, **we need to deploy the XGBoost Classifier classification model which can accurately detect the class 1 examples.**\n"
